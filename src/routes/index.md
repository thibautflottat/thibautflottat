# Thibaut Flottat

Ph. D. in statistical physics, I am a post-doctoral fellow since September 2021 at [Simatlab](https://simatlab.com). I am working on Ions Exchange Membranes (IEM) for hydrogen fuel cells and water electrolyzers applications, using classical and reactive molecular dynamics.

Before that, I was development engineer at CELAD for the CNES, working on Megha-Tropiques mission to study the water cycle in the tropical atmosphere in the context of climate change.

I have obtained my Ph. D. at the University Nice-Sophia Antipolis in the field of ultracold atoms and condensed matter theory under the supervision of [George Batrouni](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5wZZnu8AAAAJ&hl=fr). My research activities focused on strongly correlated systems in atomic gases loaded on optical lattices and cavity quantum electrodynamics. These systems are governed by extended Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonians which I mainly tackled with exact numerical methods (quantum Monte Carlo and exact diagonalization) and approximated approaches (mean field theory).
