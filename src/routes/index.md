# Thibaut Flottat

I am a computational physicist in classical and quantum physical chemistry, who enjoys solving complex scientific and mathematical problems using computers. I am mostly working with molecular simulation and am always keen to learn new techniques, methods and informatic languages.
Currently I write programs to understand structure/properties of Ions Exchange Membranes at the molecular scale.
