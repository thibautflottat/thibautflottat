# About

I am a quantum chemical physicist and scientific programmer who enjoys solving complex scientific and mathematical problems using computers. Currently I write programs to understand how particles inside atoms and molecules interact using quantum theory.

## Areas of experience:

    3Body library: Developed extensive library of high accuracy programs applicable to solving the Schrödinger equation for any three-particle system, exploring new quantum chemical physics using their wavefunctions.

    Density-Energy Space: Developed new physical framework showing a direct relationship between radial electron density and the total energy for quantum mechanical systems; a realisation of the Hohenberg and Kohn theorem.

    Electron Correlation: Calculated the current best electron correlation data for two-electron atoms through the Fully Correlated (FC) and Hartree Fock (HF) programs I developed in the 3Body library. I developed highly optimized, vectorized and parallelized C program to rapidly calculate millions of two-electron integrals using 200-digit precision with rigorous error bounds for each integral.

    Density Functional Theory Investigation: Implemented work of Colle and Salvetti (CS), Lee, Yang and Parr (LYP) and other DFT functionals to interface with my high accuracy FC and HF wavefunctions.

    Weakly Bound and Excited States: Implemented theoretical methodologies to analyse asymmetric behaviour of fermions in two-electron systems. I developed a deep learning inspired GPU technique using PyTorch to successfuly circumvent computational difficulties owing to ill-conditioned matrices.

I have expertise in greater than double precision calculations using DoubleDouble/QuadDouble data types as well as ball arithmetic; and parallel/GPU programming techniques using a variety of programming languages. I also routinely use machine learning in my research.

I run a blog called Textbook to Terminal, T>T, where I discuss scientific and mathematical related problems and how to program them (click the link on your left!)

In my spare time I enjoy powerlifting and strongman training, astrophotography, oil painting and tinkering with Raspberry Pi’s.
